#About 

Hello, World! 

My name is Chenghan (Kevin) Wang, also know as 王成晗. Currently, I am an Research Assistant from [the EDA Center](http://www.ime.cas.cn/eda/), [Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ime.ac.cn/). My research interest is Electronic Design Automation (EDA) of advanced packaging, particularly multiphysics simulation and physical design.

Prior to this RA job, I was a Master student (2021-2024) in the same place, superviosed by [Prof. Qinzhi Xu](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0066358). In 2017-2021, I was a undergraduate student in Electronic Science and Technology from [the School of Information Science and Engineering](https://siee.hitwh.edu.cn/), [Harbin Institute of Technology at Weihai](https://www.hitwh.edu.cn/).
